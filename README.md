# SQLBuilder
A GUI Java app which connects to the database and allows creation of simple SQL scripts using the UI instead of writing them by hand.
Java and Spring (it was built to work as a .jar executable using Spring).
I only attach the Java classes (to show the code), it might need some configuration to run.
GUI was written by hand, no GUI builders.
